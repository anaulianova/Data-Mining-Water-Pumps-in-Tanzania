# Solving the Water Crisis in Tanzania -- Exploring Water Well Functionality


### Project Overview
Today Tanzania is facing an important water crisis with millions amongst its population currently lacking access to safe, clean water and sanitation. As a result, many people are suffering. 
In this project, the objective is to dive into this crisis, focusing on the analysis of water well functionality accross the country in order to assess the level of the crisis and explore some possible solutions towards improving the situation for millions of people. 


The business problem is defined as follows: the Wtaer Ministry of Tanzania is reviewing its funding plans and future allocation of resources for the development and amanagement of water and sanitation in the country. 
The objective is to to allocate funding and resources towards the improvement and further development of the water and sination industry in the country in order to provide greater access to more people to clean water, which is still a challenge in the country today. 

### Data
>	Data on Water Pumps in Tanzania, (Source: Driven Data); 

### Methodology

- Clean data and perform EDA on the various features included
- Prepare the data for modeling
- Examine the performancec of a baseline KNN and RandomForest model


##### Findings & Recommendations

- The Tanzania Water Ministry should focus its funding in developing water pumps in line with the features observed in the model (mainly location focused), and subsequently improve water distribution newtorks. 
- The government should also further liaise with local authorities in a select number of districts to ensure the management is fully regulated in order to reduce the amount of wtaer wells operating without permits. 


### Future Work
Provided more time, future work would look more closely at the important features identified through the models explored in order to narrow down recommednations towards specific action points. 
These features would be examine alongs the following axis:
- Natural Resource: looking closer at the specificities of the qulality, quantity and other such features to assess their impact on well functionality to provide more specific ecommendations on better locations for water pump development
- Management: looking at the combination of features that could inform 'best practices' for the management and operation of water wells in the country to ensure the longevity of their functionality
