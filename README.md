# Data Mining Water Wells in Tanzania


### Project Overview
The business problem is defined as follows: the Wtaer Ministry of Tanzania is reviewing its funding plans and future allocation of resources for the development and amanagement of water and sanitation in the country. 
The objective is to to allocate funding and resources towards the improvement and further development of the water and sination industry in the country in order to provide greater access to more people to clean water, which is still a challenge in the country today. 

### Data
>	Data on Water Pumps in Tanzania, (Source: Driven Data); 

### Methodology

- Clean data and perform EDA on the various features included
- Prepare the data for modeling
- Examine the performancec of a baseline KNN and RandomForest model
- Perform hyperparameter tuning on train data, addressing esp class imbalance to improve model


##### Recommendations

> The Tanzania Water Ministry should focus its funding in developing water pumps in line with the features observed in the model (mainly location focused), and subsequently improve water distribution newtorks. 
> The government should also further liaise with local authorities in a select number of districts to ensure the management is fully regulated.


### Future Work
Provided more time, future modeling could include looking more closely at the effect of common points of interest on housing prices in area, not solely by their presence in the neighborhood, but by the scale of that present as well (For example, separating primary schools from university, and looking at which areas have a stronger concentration of restaurants or the like). 
Within the presently defined business problem, it would also be interesting, provided the data, to explore the evolution of housing prices over time, as well as the change in influential factors and trends.
